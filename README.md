# Flashcards-Solo-Project

A solo project during the first week of Module 2 at the Turing School of Software & Design.

## Project Overview

This program simulates a set of flash cards through the command line. A user is able to view questions, take guesses and see a final score at the end of the round. The primary focus of this project was to utilize test driven development to develop a robust testing suite that was used to guide the implementation of code to create the object-oriented application. All code is written in JavaScript.
